    For other uses, see Capybara (disambiguation).
    The capybara or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a giant cavy rodent native to South
      America. It
      is the largest living rodent and a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. The only other extant member is the lesser
      capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius). Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more
      distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests,
      and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100
      individuals, but usually live in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is hunted for its meat and hide and
      also for grease from its thick fatty skin.
  
  
    Etymology
    
    Its common name is derived from Tupi ka'apiûara, a complex agglutination of kaá (leaf) + píi (slender) + ú (eat)
      +
      ara (a suffix for agent nouns), meaning "one who eats slender leaves", or "grass-eater".[4] The genus name,
      hydrochoerus, comes from Greek ὕδωρ (hydor "water") and χοῖρος (choiros "pig, hog") and the species name,
      hydrochaeris, comes from Greek ὕδωρ (hydor "water") and χαίρω (chairo "feel happy, enjoy").
